2. open Google Chrome (or any chromium based browser) and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. toggle developer mode in the top-right corner of the page.

## Freezing?
All of the sudden on June 3, 2019 this hack started freezing. There wasn't even a surviv update. We are still trying to find out why and patch it but for now here are some things that seem to work.

- don't play in full-screen (at least not the first-round)

## Help
#### The cheat isn't aiming
You have to hold the right (secondary) mouse button to aim. There is a way to disable this.

#### I don't want autoloot
Kill yourself. Jokes aside there is a way to disable this.

#### SpinBot's not working
SpinBot&trade; is only for _special_ people.
