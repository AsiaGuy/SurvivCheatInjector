## Installation
To install the cheat:

1. Extract the `ZIP` file into a folder (remember that path).
2. Open Google Chrome (or any chromium based browser) and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Toggle developer mode in the top-right corner of the page.
4. Click `load unpacked` on the left-hand side.

## Help
#### The cheat isn't aiming
You have to hold the right (secondary) mouse button to aim by default. You can turn on AutoAim for it to aim automatically for you.

#### I don't want autoloot
Kill yourself. Jokes aside there is a way to disable this. With the click of a button that is...

#### SpinBot's not working
SpinBot&trade; is only for _special_ people.
